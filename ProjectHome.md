SdfMetz computes metrics for Antlr, Bison, SDF and DMS grammars.
Among the supported metrics are counters of terminals, non-terminals, productions, and disambiguation constructs, McCabe's cyclometric complexity, and structure metrics such as tree impurity and normalized count of grammar levels.

The metrics implemented by SdfMetz are explained and illustrated in:

This technical report also shows metric values for 27 non-trivial grammars, and some discussion of the interpretation of this data. Some exerpts from the report are included below. A companion tool SdfCoverage, for measuring grammar coverage is also mentioned in the report.

## Future work ##

Apart from adding more metrics to the repertoire of SdfMetz, we intend to do the following:

  * Collect more grammars for experimentation
  * Perform more comprehensive statistical analysis on the collected data
