SdfMetz  -- SDF Monitor.

SdfMetz computes metrics for SDF grammars. Among the supported metrics are 
counters of terminals, non-terminals, productions, and disambiguation 
constructs, McCabe's cyclometric complexity, and structure metrics such as tree 
impurity and normalized count of grammar levels.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USAGE

Just type "SdfMetz -h" at the command line to receive an overview of the
command line options.
Due some restrictions, the tool can only be run in the folder where it is
compiled.

REQUIREMENTS

  To build from sources, you need:

  - GHC                         tested with 6.2.2
    http://www.haskell.org/ghc/
    
  - SDF2 Bundle                 tested with 2.0.1
    http://www.program-transformation.org/Sdf/Sdf2BundleRelease201
    
  Note: Due to language changes (both in the SDF language and in the ghc
        compiler) it is recomended to not use newer versions of the software
        
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALL

 To install just do "make".
 Two folders will be created with generated files "odir" with object files and
 "hidir" with .hi (haskell interface) files. The SdfMetz executable will be
 created in the current folder.
